                        <p>Albert Einstein <em>born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Germany—died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.</em> was a German-born 
                            physicist who developed the special and general <strong>theories of relativity</strong>, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
                             and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his 
                            explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.
                            another important influence on Einstein was a young medical student, Max Talmud (later Max Talmey), who often had dinner at the Einstein 
                            home. Talmud became an informal tutor, introducing Einstein to higher mathematics and philosophy. A pivotal turning point occurred 
                            when Einstein was 16 years old. Talmud had earlier introduced him to a children’s science series by Aaron Bernstein

                            E=mc^2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation." He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect
                            Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius." His theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe, and his legacy continues to influence scientific thought and popular culture. occurred
